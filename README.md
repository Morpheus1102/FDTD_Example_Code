# FDTD Example Code

This repository contains a collection of Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) algorithm examples for simulating electromagnetic wave propagation in 1D, 2D, and 3D spaces. It also includes the implementation of Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) to absorb outgoing waves and minimize reflections at the boundaries.

## Contents

1. **1D FDTD Algorithm**:
   - Basic 1D FDTD Implementation
   - 1D FDTD with PML

2. **2D FDTD Algorithm**:
   - Basic 2D FDTD Implementation
   - 2D FDTD with PML

3. **3D FDTD Algorithm**:
   - Basic 3D FDTD Implementation
   - 3D FDTD with PML

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone git@github.com:Morpheus1102/FDTD_Example_Code.git
```

Navigate to the desired directory (1D, 2D, or 3D) and run the code using the appropriate interpreter for the programming language used.

## Structure

The repository is organized into three main folders, one for each dimension (1D, 2D, 3D), with subfolders for the basic FDTD implementation and PML variant.
